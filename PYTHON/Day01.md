## **Day 1: Python Fundamentals, Installation, and Your First Program**

### **Objective**
By the end of Day 1, youâ€™ll have installed Python, understand what Python is and why it's popular, and gain hands-on experience with basic commands and Pythonâ€™s interactive interpreter. Youâ€™ll also start programming by writing and running simple scripts.

### **1. Theory**

#### **1.1 Introduction to Python**

- **What is Python?**
  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers. Itâ€™s used widely across many fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.
  
- **Why Learn Python?**
  - **Readability**: Pythonâ€™s syntax is clear and intuitive, often resembling plain English.
  - **Versatility**: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.
  - **Rich Libraries**: It comes with a massive ecosystem of libraries for almost any task, from data analysis (`pandas`, `numpy`) to web development (`Flask`, `Django`), and more.
  - **Community Support**: Being one of the most popular languages, Python has vast documentation, tutorials, and a helpful community for support.

#### **1.2 Setting Up Python**

- **Download Python**:
  - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest stable release for your OS.
  - During installation, check the box to **Add Python to PATH** (important for command-line use).

- **Verifying the Installation**:
  - Open your command line (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac/Linux).
  - Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see a message showing the installed Python version (e.g., `Python 3.10.2`).

#### **1.3 Understanding the Python Interpreter and Scripts**

- **Python Interpreter**:
  - This is the interactive mode where you can type Python commands directly, and they execute immediately. To open the Python interpreter:
    ```shell
    python
    ```
  - You can test code snippets here quickly, but they wonâ€™t be saved.

- **Python Scripts**:
  - Scripts are files containing a sequence of Python commands. They allow you to save and reuse code. Scripts have a `.py` extension, like `my_script.py`.
  - To create and run a script:
    1. Open a text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
    2. Write code in the file, save it as `my_script.py`.
    3. In the command line, navigate to the scriptâ€™s folder and run:
       ```shell
       python my_script.py
       ```

### **2. Practical Examples and Concepts**

#### **2.1 Running Your First Program**

- Open Python in interactive mode (type `python` in the terminal).
- Write your first line of code:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
  - The `print()` function outputs text to the console. In this case, it outputs `Hello, World!`.

#### **2.2 Using Python as a Calculator**

Python can handle a variety of arithmetic operations just like a calculator. Try out each of the following in the interpreter or a script:

```python
# Basic operations
print(5 + 3)       # Addition: outputs 8
print(5 - 3)       # Subtraction: outputs 2
print(5 * 3)       # Multiplication: outputs 15
print(5 / 3)       # Division (float result): outputs 1.6667
print(5 // 3)      # Floor division (integer result): outputs 1
print(5 % 3)       # Modulus (remainder): outputs 2
print(5 ** 3)      # Exponentiation (power): outputs 125
```

Each operation will display an output. This can be a great way to start experimenting with basic commands in Python.

#### **2.3 Comments**

Comments are essential for documenting code. In Python:
- **Single-line comment**: Use `#` to mark a comment:
  ```python
  # This is a single-line comment
  print("Comments are ignored by the interpreter")
  ```
- **Multi-line comment**: Use triple quotes (`""" ... """`) to create a multi-line comment:
  ```python
  """
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span multiple lines.
  """
  ```

### **3. Key Functions for Beginners**

#### **3.1 The `print()` Function**

- **Basics of `print()`**:
  - The `print()` function is used to output data to the console. This function takes various types of data as input.
  ```python
  print("Welcome to Python")           # String
  print(123)                            # Integer
  print(3.14)                           # Float
  ```

- **Printing Multiple Items**:
  - You can separate items in `print()` with commas to print them on the same line:
    ```python
    print("Python version:", 3.10)
    ```

- **Using `sep` and `end` in `print()`**:
  - `sep`: Change the separator between multiple items.
  - `end`: Change whatâ€™s printed at the end of the output.
    ```python
    print("Hello", "World", sep="-")   # Output: Hello-World
    print("Hello", end="!")            # Output: Hello!
    ```

### **4. Hands-On Practice Exercises**

After going through these concepts, work through these exercises. Aim to solve each one to reinforce todayâ€™s learning.

1. **Exercise: Print Statements**
   - Write a script that prints:
     - A greeting message (e.g., "Welcome to Python").
     - Your favorite quote.
     - A fun fact about yourself.

2. **Exercise: Basic Math**
   - Calculate and print the result of the following expressions:
     - \( 10 + 15 \)
     - \( 45 - 12 \)
     - \( 8 \times 3 \)
     - \( 10 \div 2 \)
     - \( 7^2 \) (7 to the power of 2)
     - The remainder of dividing 17 by 3.
   - Write these in a Python script, and display each result on a new line.

3. **Exercise: Comments**
   - Write a script that contains at least five lines of code and comment each line to explain what it does.

4. **Exercise: Print Formatting**
   - Write a single line of code using `print()` that displays:
     ```plaintext
     Name: <Your Name>, Age: <Your Age>, Hobby: <Your Hobby>
     ```
   - Replace `<Your Name>`, `<Your Age>`, and `<Your Hobby>` with your details.

5. **Exercise: Explore `print()`**
   - Use `print()` to output:
     - The numbers 1 to 5 on the same line, separated by commas.
     - A message that ends with a custom punctuation mark (e.g., `"Hello there!"`).
   - Use the `sep` and `end` parameters to modify these print statements as needed.

### **5. Wrap-Up: Review and Reflect**

By the end of today, you should be comfortable with the basics of Python installation, using the interpreter, writing simple scripts, and utilizing the `print()` function effectively.

#### **Additional Tips**
- Keep experimenting with `print()` to understand its versatility.
- Practice running code in both the Python interpreter and saved scripts to understand how each approach works.

#### **Reflection Questions**
1. What are the benefits of using an interpreter versus a script?
2. How can you make your code more readable using comments?
